= Waxter's Index

To compare the processes of multiple companies, a scoring model is necessary.
The following scoring model is based on my **highest conceivable ideal** within 
embedded systems development--specifically software. I egotistically call it the
Waxter's Index. A score is based on the number of fulfilled checkboxes divided
by the number of total checkboxes.

maturity model].

== Guiding Principles:
* code-as-code
* docs-as-code
* configuration-as-code
* reproducibility
* do it right
* single-source-of-truth
* https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html[nimble principles]
* assume people are trustworthy and have good intentions
* measure it

=== Version Control System
[%interactive]
* [ ] use a version control system
** [ ] code
** [ ] docs
** [ ] cad files
* [ ] conventional commits
* [ ] branch naming scheme
* [ ] standard, specified workflow (eg trunk-based development)

=== Build
[%interactive]
* [ ] Hermetic builds
* [ ] Correct builds
* [ ] Reproducible builds
* [ ] Distributed caching of artifacts
* [ ] Capability to fetch dependencies

=== Quality Control
[%interactive]
* [ ] Issue/Bug tracking system (single-source-of-truth)
* [ ] Style guides
** [ ] code
** [ ] docs
* [ ] Strong emphasis on testing
** [ ] Test-Driven Development (TDD)
*** [ ] tests run-able on host
*** [ ] tests run-able on target
** [ ] Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
** [ ] Manual testing
* [ ] Design-reviews
** [ ] code
** [ ] hardware
** [ ] docs
* [ ] Static Analysis
* [ ] CI server considered single-source-of-truth
* [ ] Warnings and errors should not be suppressed, but if necessary, they are 
      suppressed at the producing location.

=== Automation
[%interactive]
* [ ] Continuous Integration (CI)
** [ ] build project
*** [ ] build binary
*** [ ] build documentation outputs
** [ ] run unit tests
** [ ] run high-level tests (BDD)
** [ ] run hardware-in-the-loop tests
*** [ ] smoke test
*** [ ] test exercises multiple sub systems
** [ ] generate changelog (requires conventional commits)
** [ ] generate project metrics
*** [ ] Uses generated metric history to depict change overtime and current
       change
*** [ ] warnings, errors, failed tests
*** [ ] code-coverage of tests
*** [ ] resource usage of built binary
**** [ ] Flash
**** [ ] Ram
**** [ ] CPU utilization
*** [ ] percentage of code ignored by static analysis
*** [ ] readability metrics of documentation
* [ ] Continuous Deployment (CD)
* [ ] Commands run by more than 3 people are encapsulated in a wrapper script
      that is used instead.
* [ ] Developer environment setup is automated and can be deployed on a new
      machine by running 3 commands or less.
** [ ] Code-formatter
*** [ ] Can ignore sections with in-line tags
* [ ] Continuous Deployment (CD)
** [ ] Continuous Monitoring (CM)

=== Documentation
[%interactive]
* [ ] https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/[docs-as-code]
* [ ] design decisions are documented internally
** [ ] code contains description of used design patterns

=== Collaboration
[%interactive]
* [ ] Teams are formed around work rather than role
** [ ] Teams are cross-functional
* [ ] Scheduled, consistent role-based meetings. For example, embedded software
engineers from multiple teams discuss ways they can improve.
* [ ] Daily stand-ups
** [ ] less than 15 mins
* [ ] Sprint post-mortems
** [ ] technical
** [ ] collaboration
* [ ] management understands the project management triangle: resources, scope,
      schedule.
** [ ] understand limitations of varying resources
* [ ] annual benchmarking against other development teams internal and external
to company

=== Experience
[%interactive]
* [ ] Support **Linux**, Windows, and Mac workflows
* [ ] editor agnostic for writing
** [ ] code
** [ ] docs
* [ ] Kind coworkers
* [ ] engineers can choose to become more senior as engineer or to move into
      management
* [ ] office space has artwork
* [ ] office space produces artifacts which describe design principles, design 
      patterns, quotes, etc. These are posted around the office and are updated
      regularly.
* [ ] office space is hybrid of open-office and cubicles
* [ ] company sends personnel to continued-learning conferences
